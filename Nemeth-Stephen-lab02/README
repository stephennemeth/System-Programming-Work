To compile:
    run command "make compile" or
    "g++ -Wall -pedantic-errors -g -o lab02.out lab02.cpp"
To run:
    To compress:
        run command:
            "./lab02.out -c ..."
            where "..." is replaced
            with the DNA string you would like to compress.
            All letter capitailized.
            For example, "./lab02.out -c GGGGGGGG"
            will output "8 255 255".
    To decompress:
        run command:
            "./lab02.out -d ..."
            where "..." is replaced
            with the length of the DNA string and followed by
            a sequence of 8 bit integers, representing unsigned chars,
            representing a compressed DNA string,
            For example, "./lab02.out -d 8 255 255"
            8 is the length of the DNA string and
            the numbers after that represent the compressed DNA string.
            This will output GGGGGGGG as the uncompressed DNA string

    Or run command "make run" which will run predifined compress
    and decompress commands outined in the Makefile in this directory.
