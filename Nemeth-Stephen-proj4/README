to compile:
    run command "make compile"
    or run command "gcc -o proj4.out proj4.c"

to run:
    run command "make run"
    or run command "./proj4.out <file1> <file2>"
    where <file1> and <file2> are names of files
    to compare.


Time Theory:
    The reason that step1 is signinficantly slower than step2
    is because step1 is reading each individual byte one by one
    from the files so it can compare then. While, step2 is
    reading the while files into arrays and using the arrays
    to compare that two files which speeds things up signinficantly.
    Instead of calling a function each time to read a character from the file,
    checking if that character is the same, and then writing it, step2 is 
    do one call to read the entire file into arrays and then using the arrays
    to check the differences which is constant time. Then step2 is only
    using one function call to write the contents of the difference array to
    the difference file. All together this means that step2 is significantly
    faster than step1 for files of large sizes.
